## Introduction

This repository contains notebooks and documents about mainly
Deep Learning and related tools, this repository is continuously updated, as I learn more I will upload the resources here. 

## Before starting

- [ ] - Go through at least one machine learning course to understand the fundamentals. Remember that Deep Learning is a sub-field inside Machine Learning.
- [ ] - Go through the video until you have a deep understanding of the basics of neural networks: [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation - Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)

Watch this tutorial: 



## Getting started

You can download the repository directly from github or clone it with git if you're familiar with it. As for the notebooks I **highly** recommend running them in google colab, but if you want you can run them locally with jupyter notebook,
just be sure of installing the needed dependencies for each notebook (Read them before!).

Once you have the resources you can start reading the pdf (*DeepLearningPart1.pdf*) and as you complete each section you go to the respective notebook, (each notebook is appropiately named according to the topic it covers) where you will find practical exercises about the topic (most of them come with the solutions already, if you want to try them yourself you can erase the code or alternatively copy the questions and do them yourself).
